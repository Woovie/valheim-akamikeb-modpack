# Community Modpack for akamikeb

That's it. That's the mod.

Contains:

* [Epic Loot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/)
* [Creature Level and Loot Control](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/)
* And all dependencies of such

You also need Valheim Plus installed. Unfortunately this is unavailable on Thunderstore and must be installed manually.

## Valheim Plus Installation with r2modman

1. Open your r2modman profile for Valheim
2. Click Settings
3. Click "Browse profile folder"
4. Install the Valheim Plus files here

The only files you _need_ from Valheim Plus are the `ValheimPlus.dll` that should go into `BepInex/plugins`, and `valheim_plus.cfg`, which goes into `Bepinex/config`
